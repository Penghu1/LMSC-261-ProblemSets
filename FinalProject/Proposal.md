# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Web Synth

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "My project is about creating a web-based synthesizer.")

My project is a web-based synthesizer

## Detail your project in a paragraph or more. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

My product is a web-based synthesizer with interactive UI like buttons and knobs. My synthesizer include a small keyboard, a filter and envelope. The parameters of filter and envelope can be adjusted by knobs. I will use Tone.js and javascript to acheive it.

## If you plan to combine LMSC-261's final project with another course's project, which other course? Which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to LMSC-261, and which aspect(s) would connect to the other course?

The most relevant course is EP322 Sound Design. I learned about different types of synthesizers, their principles and components. In this course I tried to create them using maxmsp or modular synthesizers, which helped me a lot to understand the principles of each module and how each module relates to each other.

## In the software world, almost everything takes longer to implement than expected. And it is common to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what **WILL** you accomplish no matter what?
Make a web-based synthesizer with basic functions (OSC, envelope, filter) and simple interface
The code can be run successsfully without error


### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you **THINK** you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Have more interactive functions like a step sequencer, LFO

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a **BEST** outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

a web-based synthesizer with basic functions and intuitive and good looking interface.

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research?

I need to start learning Tone.js and learn more about making UI with javascript.
