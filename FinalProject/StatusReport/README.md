Web Synth


#### What have you done for your project so far?

I made a basic oscillator which can select waveforms in a dropdown menu. I also made an envelope with four sliders to control ADSR. I use a set of buttons desine a keyboard for triggering notes. Each button is equipped with onmousedown and onmouseup event listeners to handle playing notes

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I still need to add more functions to this synthesizer like a sequencer

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

I am trying to find a way to input midi.
